          LEPC plan must contain procedures for the timely and effective use of communications to the
          general public. The all-hazard EOP typically has an Annex dedicated to this topic. Plus, most
          ICS training teaches responders how to appoint and use a PIO as part of the command structure.
          Therefore, this process should be defined in local SOPs."
