full-activation of an EOC regardless of the incident. Some plans establish varying levels of
activation and staffing based on the type and size of the incident. In any case, the EOC should
be staffed with those agencies that can coordinate actions for the IC(s) and off-site agencies.
This includes but is not limited to response agencies, human service groups, utility services,
voluntary organizations, and elected officials."
