              the call must be ready to gather and forward this information to First Responders and key support

              of signs that a hazardous material may be involved. This information should be documented and
              passed along to the initial responders. Awareness level training also teaches First Responders to
              recognize when hazardous materials are released and to notify the appropriate agencies as per the
              local plan. As information is obtained, it should be documented and relayed in accordance with

      have been released and Ohio Department of Health (ODH) can provide support when radioactive
